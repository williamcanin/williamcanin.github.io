## Introduction

**Typing Theme**, is a template for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) built especially for those who want to have a blog and pages quickly and lightly.

Its interface is part of the "Keep It Simple" philosophy, precisely to have a high performance in all types of browsers and mobile devices.

You already have a template page for ‘Blog’, ‘Projects’, ‘Search’, ‘Contact’, ‘Tags’ and ‘Resume’, but you can leave as you want, modifying strings.

The page ‘resume’, you can print using the browser’s Ctrl + P shortcut. The printout will use the Open Sans font and will delete useless parts such as sidebar. You’ll also have templates for posts, and you’ll have to follow model the header the post’s.

The contact page uses the Formspree feature, you will have to have an account in the service, and add your email in the `_config.yml` file. Alias, all contents of the `_config.yml` file should be changed except for **SESSION PRIVATE**.
